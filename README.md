## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

## What I Learned

During this project, I picked up some new skills:

### Responsive Design
I learned how to make websites that look good on different devices. So, whether you're on a big computer or a tiny phone, the site will still be user-friendly.

### HTML Form Validation
I figured out how to check if the information people type into forms is correct. This way, the website can tell users if something's wrong before they hit submit.

### JavaScript DOM Tricks
I played around with JavaScript to change things on the webpage while people use it. For example, I made sure error messages show up when needed, making the site more helpful.


### Continued development

In the next phases of this project, I'm aiming to:

### Enhance Mobile Design
I plan to sharpen my skills in creating mobile-friendly designs. Focusing on making the website look and work great on smaller screens is my top priority.

### Strengthen JavaScript DOM Manipulation
I'll continue honing my JavaScript skills, particularly in manipulating the DOM. This includes refining how the webpage dynamically responds to user actions, creating a smoother and more interactive experience.

### Dive into Regex
I recognize the power of regular expressions (regex) in form validation and data processing. My next goal is to get comfortable working with regex to handle and validate different types of input more efficiently.
